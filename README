The IC model
1. prob_degree(G)
   Assign probability weights to the graph G according to the degree of the
   active node.

2. testg()
   Returns a testing graph that looks like that:
   Nodes:[1,2,3,4,5,6]
   Edges:[(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6)]

3. iter(G, subset)
   Returns a list that consistes of nodes that are active after all possible
   IC iterations. For example, consider the graph generated by testg(), and
   suppose the initial activated subset is [1], enter iter(testg(),[1]) to
   perform an IC iteration.
